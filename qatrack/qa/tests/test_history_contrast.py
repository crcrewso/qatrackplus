"""History labels must be readable on every pass/fail background.

Bootstrap's `.label` sets `color: #fff`, and every history label sits on one of
the five pass/fail backgrounds at the top of `qa.css`. White fails WCAG AA on
all five. `qa.css` overrides the colour for `.qa-history .label`, and these
tests compute the ratios from the stylesheet so that adding a sixth background,
or loosening the override, fails here rather than shipping.

**What went wrong, since it is three different things.** The override used to be
`th.qa-history .label`, covering only the header's date labels. `td.qa-history`
appears in `testlistinstance_detail.html`, `testlistinstance_review.html` and
`qavalue_form.html`, and in those cells numeric history values and the `N/A`
label have always rendered white on colour. String and date values were the one
case that had been patched - with `text-black` on the inner span in
`history.html` - and this branch removed that class while fixing an unclosed
`<span>` beside it. @copilot caught the string/date regression on c#27; the
other two predate the branch and are fixed by the same selector.

Parsed with tinycss2, which arrives with WeasyPrint - the same approach as
`qatrack/reports/tests/test_schedule_dialog_css.py`.
