"""Upgrade instructions must stop the web application server before they
replace what it is running.

This is a test about documentation because the documentation is the procedure:
there is no upgrade script to get wrong. `linux_upgrade_from_4_0.rst` told the
reader to stop nginx and django-q2 and then run `uv sync` and `collectstatic` -
leaving gunicorn, which supervisor runs as its own program, serving with its
Python already imported while the dependencies and templates changed under it.
Raised by Copilot on PR crcrewso#18, 2026-10-19.

A reviewer cannot be relied on to notice an omission in a list of shell
commands, so the invariant is pinned here instead.
