Query Tool
==========

.. warning::

    In order to use SQL Reports, your site administrator must have set up a
    read-only database user, and configured QATrack+ to use this read-only user
    in it's :ref:`DATABASES <databases>` setting.

    You must also set :ref:`USE_SQL_REPORTS = True<qatrack-config>` in your
    local_settings.py file.  If you are using SQL Server your readonly database
    options may also need to set `AUTOCOMMIT = False`.


As of version 3.1.0 QATrack+ has a tool for creating, running, and storing SQL
database queries/reports. To access the tool, select the **Query Tool** option
from the `Trends & Analysis` menu.

From this main query tool page, you can select an existing query to run, or
create a new one using the `New Query` or `Playground` links in the sidebar.

Permissions Required
--------------------

Currently, to access this tool a user must have the :ref:`"Can Run SQL Reports"
or "Can Create SQL Reports" <qa_auth>` permission set on their account.


Creating a new Query
--------------------

.. note::

    If you want to run ad-hoc queries or develop a new query, you can use the
    `Playground` area to run queries without saving them to the database for
    later use.


Give your query a title and description and then write your query in the SQL
text area:

Once you have written your query you can click `Save & Run` to generate your
query. This will save the query for later use and run it now placing the results
at the bottom of the page:

Adding parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add a configurable parameter to use in the query add a symbol like
`$$your_param_name$$` to your query. For each parameter an input box will be
added to configure the query.  You can use `$$your_param_name:default_value$$`
to have a default value filled in:

Exporting the query

If you would like to download your data, simply use the drop down on the `Save
& Run` button to export your data to CSV, Excel, or JSON format.

Viewing the DB Schema
---------------------

You can view the database tables and columns available by clicking on the `Show
Schema` button.  A full database diagram is also available in the developer
documents: :ref:`Database Schema <dev_schema>`.

Pivot Tables
------------

After running a query you can click on the `Pivot` link at the top of the
results table to generate a pivot table for aggregating and summarizing the
data. Note the link at the top right can be shared with others to link
directly to this pivot table.
