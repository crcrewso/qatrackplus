This diagram is regenerated on demand (see *Generating the schema diagram*
below) rather than on every release, so it may lag behind the current
version - regenerate it if you need one that reflects the latest models.


Generating the schema diagram
-----------------------------


Ubuntu
~~~~~~

On Ubuntu (tested on 18.04) you need to install a few dependencies before
generating the schema diagram:

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo apt install python-dev graphviz libgraphviz-dev pkg-config 
    uv pip install pygraphviz         

and then you can generate your schema with:

.. code-block:: sh

    make schema

which will output the schema to docs/developer/images/qatrack_schema_$(VERSION).svg


Windows
~~~~~~~

It is also possible to generate a schema diagram on Windows using Sql Server
Management Studio. See
https://dataedo.com/kb/tools/ssms/create-database-diagram for instructions on
making a diagram with SSMS.
