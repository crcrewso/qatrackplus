Continue to add tests in this fashion (you can add many tests without

When you are finished click **Save and continue editing** and confirm
that all your tests are present. See the section below for instructions
on how to reorder the tests if required.

row into a new position in the list. After you have finished reordering click
**Save and continue editing** and ensure all your tests are now in the correct
order.
