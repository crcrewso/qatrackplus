.. This file is a fragment, pulled into each platform's 4.0.1 to 4.0.2 upgrade guide
   with `.. include::`. It is excluded from the build in conf.py, because an included
   file that is also read as a document has every label in it reported as a
   duplicate.

   It holds what is true of the release regardless of how QATrack+ is deployed, so
   the per-platform guides differ only where the commands differ.

Before you start
----------------

**Back up your database and your uploads first, and check the backup opens.** This
release runs migrations, which the previous patch release did not.

.. danger::

    **4.0.2 changes your database schema.** 4.0.1 did not, so if your upgrade
    routine has never had to account for migrations, this is the release where it
    does.

    Nothing here deletes data. The migrations record field descriptions the models
    have always declared, and restore unique constraints that SQL Server lost during
    the 4.0 upgrade. But a schema change is a schema change: take the backup, and
    confirm it is readable before you begin. :ref:`qatrack_backup` says what a backup
    set has to contain, and - if your production database is SQLite - how to take one
    that is actually readable, which a file copy of a live database is not.

**What you will see, so you can tell it apart from a problem.** ``migrate`` prints
one line per migration. Upgrading 4.0.1 to 4.0.2 applies **eight**, one for most
applications plus one that creates the cache table:

.. code-block:: text

    Applying attachments.0011_v4_0_2_final... OK
    Applying faults.0016_v4_0_2_final... OK
    Applying parts.0019_v4_0_2_final... OK
    Applying qa.0061_v4_0_2_final... OK
    Applying qatrack_core.0002_cache_table... OK
    Applying reports.0011_v4_0_2_final... OK
    Applying service_log.0029_v4_0_2_final... OK
    Applying units.0022_v4_0_2_final... OK

Between them they carry **194 field alterations**, one model-options change and
five data steps. The field alterations are the bulk of it and are the least
interesting part: they bring the recorded schema into line with what the models
have declared for several releases, so most make no change to your tables at all.
The ``qa`` one is the largest at 132.

Two of those lines are worth recognising:

- **``qa.0061_v4_0_2_final``** is where the SQL Server unique-constraint repair
  runs, so on SQL Server this is the line that matters. It is also the slowest.
- **``qatrack_core.0002_cache_table``** creates the cache table. Until 4.0.2 that
  table was created by ``manage.py createcachetable`` and by nothing else, so a
  database that had been migrated but never had that command run would fail at
  runtime. This migration removes that gap; if you have already run
  ``createcachetable``, it finds the table and does nothing.

If ``migrate`` prints more than these eight, or names a migration that is not in
this list, stop and ask before continuing - it means the database is not at the
version you think it is.

.. note::

    These eight are the whole 4.0.1 to 4.0.2 step. A **fresh** installation runs
    the full history instead, which is 227 migrations and takes several minutes -
    that is normal, and not what an upgrading site sees.

.. dropdown:: If you are on SQL Server, read this one
    :color: warning
    :icon: alert

    The 4.0 migrations silently dropped unique indexes on SQL Server -
    ``mssql-django`` drops them when an unrelated field change retypes a primary
    key, and never puts them back. **Your database has been accepting duplicate
    rows that other backends would reject**, including on
    ``TestListInstance.user_key``, whose job is to keep API submissions unique.

    **4.0.2 restores them.** You do not have to do anything, but two things are
    worth knowing:

    - **``migrate`` prints a warning for each missing constraint**
      (``qatrack.W011``) before it applies anything, and then the same ``migrate``
      repairs them. The warnings are not telling you to act.

      To see them without migrating, the command is ``python manage.py check
      --database default``. **Plain ``manage.py check`` will not show them**: this
      check has to ask the database what it enforces, so it is registered to run only
      when a connection is in play, and ``check`` without ``--database`` reports
      "System check identified no issues" on a database that is missing all sixteen.
    - **Rows that already violate a constraint block its repair.** Run
      ``manage.py check_unique_constraints`` first to see whether you have any. A
      constraint that cannot be created is reported and skipped; the upgrade still
      finishes.

.. dropdown:: Dates and times will look different, and that is this release
    :color: warning
    :icon: alert

    **Dates now display as ``YYYY-MM-DD`` by default**, in every language, and the
    date pickers write back the same format they show.

    This is the fix for a released bug: 4.0 wrote a date into a form in one format
    and read it back in another, so a pre-filled date was silently replaced with an
    unrelated one - usually months away and at midnight - before anyone had touched
    the page.

    If your site needs its previous appearance, set ``QATRACK_DATE_FORMAT`` and
    ``QATRACK_DATETIME_FORMAT`` in ``local_settings.py``. The release notes give the
    values that reproduce 4.0's display.
