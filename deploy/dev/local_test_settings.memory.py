        # Stated, not inferred. Django ignores NAME for a SQLite test run and
        # uses TEST['NAME'], substituting ':memory:' when it is unset - so this

# `readonly` must be a *copy* that mirrors `default`, not the same dict object.
# Django's test runner sets up every alias in DATABASES, so an alias which *is*
# `default` is created and flushed twice. With `:memory:` both names resolve to
# one database and the second pass is harmless, which is why this went unnoticed;
# file-backed, it is not. Measured 2026-11-01 on the GUI suite against a file:
# 35 failures, 34 errors and 106 occurrences of `attempt to write a readonly
# database`, with zero lock errors - the second setup leaves the shared file
# read-only for the connection the first one is still using.
#
# `TEST: {'MIRROR': 'default'}` is Django's own answer for a replica: no second
# test database is built, and `readonly` is routed to `default`'s connection.
